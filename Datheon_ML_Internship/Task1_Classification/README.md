## 1. Project Overview & Objectives

This repository contains the complete implementation for **Task 1: Multi-Class Benchmark Classification Pipeline** of the **Datheon Machine Learning & Data Science Internship**.

The project delivers a production-grade machine learning workflow on Fisher's canonical Iris dataset, benchmarked across two contrasting algorithmic paradigms:
1. **Parametric Linear Modeling:** Multinomial Logistic Regression (`LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)`) with feature standardization encapsulated in a Scikit-Learn `Pipeline` to eliminate data leakage.
2. **Non-Parametric Tree Partitioning:** Decision Tree Classifier (`DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)`).

### Core Assignment Requirements Fulfilled
- [x] Ingest official dataset from the upstream source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv` with automated fallback handling.
- [x] Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Shape, schema, data types, descriptive statistics, missing value audit, class balance verification, and Seaborn multi-variate pairplots.
- [x] Leakage-free preprocessing: 80:20 stratified split (`test_size=0.20`, `random_state=42`, `stratify=y`) and training-set-isolated `StandardScaler` pipeline.
- [x] Benchmark training and multi-class evaluation: Accuracy, Weighted Precision, Weighted Recall, Weighted F1-Score, detailed `classification_report`, and dual confusion matrix heatmaps.
- [x] High-resolution 2D Decision Boundary visualization on selected features (`petal_length` and `petal_width`) with explicit engineering notes distinguishing 2D visualization from 4D production models.
- [x] Benchmark metrics comparison grouped bar chart.
- [x] Rigorous conclusions strictly based on actual experimental outputs (zero fabricated metrics).
- [x] Executable, fully evaluated Jupyter Notebook (`Task1_MultiClass_Classification.ipynb`).

## 3. Dataset & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The dataset contains 150 botanical observations categorized into three botanical species (**Iris setosa**, **Iris versicolor**, **Iris virginica**), with 50 samples per class.

### 3.1 Dataset Schema & Statistics
- **Features ($X \in \mathbb{R}^4$):**
  - `sepal_length` (float64, continuous, cm): Mean = 5.84, Std = 0.83, Range = [4.3, 7.9]
  - `sepal_width` (float64, continuous, cm): Mean = 3.06, Std = 0.44, Range = [2.0, 4.4]
  - `petal_length` (float64, continuous, cm): Mean = 3.76, Std = 1.77, Range = [1.0, 6.9]
  - `petal_width` (float64, continuous, cm): Mean = 1.20, Std = 0.76, Range = [0.1, 2.5]
- **Target ($y$):** `species` (categorical object: `setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`)
- **Missing Values:** Zero (0) null/missing values across all rows and columns.

### 3.2 Target Class Balance
The dataset features a perfectly balanced 1:1:1 tri-class distribution:
- **setosa:** 50 samples (33.33%)
- **versicolor:** 50 samples (33.33%)
- **virginica:** 50 samples (33.33%)

![Class Distribution](outputs/class_distribution.png)

### 3.3 Multi-Variate Separability (Seaborn Pairplot)
A multi-variate pairplot was generated using `sns.pairplot(..., hue='species', diag_kind='kde')`:
- **Iris setosa** is strictly linearly separable along all bivariate projections involving petal measurements (`petal_length`, `petal_width`).
- **Iris versicolor** and **Iris virginica** exhibit close proximity with a small boundary overlap in the region of `petal_length` $\in [4.5, 5.1]$ cm and `petal_width` $\in [1.4, 1.8]$ cm.
- Petal dimensions exhibit Pearson correlation $r > 0.96$, serving as the primary variance components for classification.

## 4. Methodology & Leakage-Free Preprocessing Pipeline

### 4.1 Stratified Train-Test Splitting
To evaluate genuine out-of-sample generalization without sampling bias, the data is split using an 80:20 ratio:
- **Training Set:** 120 samples (40 setosa, 40 versicolor, 40 virginica)
- **Holdout Test Set:** 30 samples (10 setosa, 10 versicolor, 10 virginica)
- `random_state=42` ensures strict reproducibility.
- `stratify=y` guarantees that the test partition preserves the exact $1/3$ class distribution.

### 4.2 Preventing Data Leakage via Scikit-Learn `Pipeline`
Fitting a standardizer (`StandardScaler`) across the full dataset prior to partitioning leaks test-set distributional parameters ($\mu_{test}, \sigma_{test}$) into the training phase, yielding overly optimistic error estimates.

To prevent leakage, feature scaling is encapsulated inside an official `sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`:
```python
lr_pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42))
])
lr_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- `StandardScaler.fit()` computes sample mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) **strictly from $X_{train}$**.
- During testing and future inference, $X_{test}$ is transformed using the previously learned training parameters without refitting.

## 5. Empirical Benchmark Results

Both models were fitted on the 120-sample training fold and evaluated on the identical 30-sample stratified test fold.

| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Logistic Regression (Pipeline with StandardScaler)** | **0.9333 (93.33%)** | **0.9333** | **0.9333** | **0.9333** | **28 / 30** |
| **Decision Tree Classifier (`random_state=42`)** | **0.9333 (93.33%)** | **0.9333** | **0.9333** | **0.9333** | **28 / 30** |

weighted avg     0.9333    0.9333    0.9333        30
```

### 5.3 Confusion Matrix Heatmaps
Both models demonstrated identical error structures:
- **Setosa:** 10/10 correct (100% precision and recall)
- **Versicolor:** 9/10 correct (1 misclassified as virginica)
- **Virginica:** 9/10 correct (1 misclassified as versicolor)

![Confusion Matrices](outputs/confusion_matrices.png)

### 5.4 Error Diagnostics: Morphological Boundary Overlap
Analysis of the misclassified test samples reveals that both models failed on the exact same two botanical specimens:
1. **Sample Index 77:** Ground truth = `versicolor`, predicted = `virginica` (`petal_length` = 5.0 cm, `petal_width` = 1.7 cm).
2. **Sample Index 106:** Ground truth = `virginica`, predicted = `versicolor` (`petal_length` = 4.5 cm, `petal_width` = 1.7 cm).

Both specimens inhabit the ambiguous morphometric boundary where `versicolor` and `virginica` distributions overlap, indicating irreducible Bayes error rather than model bias or variance.

## 6. Visualizations

### 6.1 2D Decision Boundary Surface Comparison

> **Engineering Note:** The primary benchmark models utilize all four feature dimensions ($X \in \mathbb{R}^4$). For human-interpretable 2D decision boundary visualization, dedicated surrogate models were trained on the two highest-variance features: `petal_length` and `petal_width`.

![Decision Boundaries](outputs/decision_boundaries.png)

- **Logistic Regression (Left):** Generates smooth, continuous linear decision boundaries defined by hyperplanes in normalized space.
- **Decision Tree (Right):** Generates orthogonal, axis-aligned step partitions defined by recursive binary inequalities ($x_j \le \theta$).

### 6.2 Benchmark Metrics Comparison Chart
The side-by-side grouped bar chart illustrates identical performance across all four primary classification metrics:

## 7. Senior Machine Learning Engineer Conclusions

1. **Parity in Benchmark Performance:** Both models achieved an identical test accuracy of **93.33%** and weighted F1-score of **0.9333**, reflecting the high discriminative power of the Iris morphological features.
2. **Structural Decision Differences:**
   - **Logistic Regression** optimizes a smooth cross-entropy loss with L2 regularization, producing well-calibrated posterior probabilities ($P(y=k|X)$) suitable for risk-sensitive decision thresholds.
   - **Decision Tree** optimizes Gini impurity step cuts, yielding highly interpretable if-else decision rules without requiring feature scaling, but prone to higher variance on small datasets.
3. **Architectural Best Practice:** Feature standardization must always be embedded within a Scikit-Learn `Pipeline` when deploying parametric estimators to eliminate data leakage and ensure seamless inference on raw incoming vectors.
4. **Production Recommendation:** For production deployment, **Logistic Regression via Pipeline** is recommended for superior probability calibration, lower variance, and robustness against unconstrained tree memorization.
